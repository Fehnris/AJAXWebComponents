# AJAXWebComponents

AJAXWebComponents is currently in development.  The goal of this project is to design a set of website components that add functionality to existing HTML DOM elements with less code by creating reusable javascript objects that handle extra functionality internally.  An example of extra functions that this project aims to provide could be auto complete on input text fields with dynamically loadable data possibly through AJAX when the text field has a value entered into it.  Individual components will be designed as single objects that can be included as and when needed in a web project.
